This is a collection of functions for local polynomial
smoothing with a local bandwidth computed by EBBS (Ruppert,
1997, JASA).  The .m files in this directory use .m files
in the main directory of .m files and in the subdirectory
lpoly.  (Any file whose name begins "lpoly" is in the subdirectory
lpoly.)  Many of these .m files need to call .m files in the
directory "utility".

auto17.m:  	This is the main driver program.  You probably will not
		call it directly, but all other ebbs functions call it.

autobic.m:	EBBS for bivariate regression functions (under development)

ebbslogit.m:	EBBS for local logistic regression

ebbsmv01.m:	Calls ebbsmvparam with default values of the parameters.
		(Though non-default values can be passed in.)
		This is the function that most users will call.  It
		estimates the mean function or derivative thereof and
		the variance function.  It calls the following: autob17,
		lpolydb, ebbsvar, lpolyres, bspan, ebbsmvparam, lpolyvar, 
		prebin (all these are in the directory "utility").


ebbspam.m:	Fits a semiparametric additive model, as discussed
		in Opsomer and Ruppert, A root-n consistent backfitting 
		estimator for semiparametric additive modelling. 
		JCGS, 8, 715--732.

ebbsden.m:	Calls ebbsdensity with default parameters

ebbsdensity.m:	Estimates probability densities

ebbsvar.m:	Estimates variance functions.  Usually used indirectly
		by calling ebbsmv01
